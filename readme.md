# RefineryCMS Tutorials Site

This is a port of the refinerycms tutorials site [http://tutorials.refinerycms.org](http://tutorials.refinerycms.org) from jekyll to refinerycms.

## Why?

Problems with jekyll:

- hard to contribute
- lacking features
- not refinerycms

Possible solutions:

- give trusted people user accounts in refinery to edit and make new pages
- some sort of tutorials plugin that allows for user signup, versioning, etc.
- a [refinerycms-wiki](http://github.com/parndt/refinerycms-wiki) plugin [**IN PROGRESS**]

## How can I help?

This idea came from the nice people on the IRC channel, go there to contribute your suggestions as well:

    irc.freenode.net
    #refinerycms

Or, if you have an aversion to Internet chatting over the relay, you may fork this project and contribute some functionality that you feel we're desperately missing. Either way, we'd _love_ your help.  If you're extra good, you'll get commit rights to the core repository (hint: this one) if you want them.

Right now I'm just getting the theme transferred over, so most of the work is happening in the themes/tutorials folder. Please contribute, thanks!

## RefineryCMS-Wiki

Step #1 is to create a wiki, which is a plugin collaboration taking place here: [http://github.com/parndt/refinerycms-wiki](http://github.com/parndt/refinerycms-wiki)
