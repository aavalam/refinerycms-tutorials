# RefineryCMS Tutorials Site

This is the open source code of the refinerycms tutorials site [http://tutorials.refinerycms.org](http://tutorials.refinerycms.org) which obviously uses a refinerycms backend.

This website is run by the nice people on the IRC channel, go there to contribute your suggestions as well:

    irc.freenode.net
    #refinerycms

## Can I contribute tutorials?

**PLEASE CONTRIBUTE TUTORIALS!** Contact someone on the IRC or use the 'Suggestions' form on the website to tell us your ideas. We'll give you a login code so you can write your brand new tutorial.

## Can I help with the code?

You may fork this project and contribute some functionality that you feel we're desperately missing. Either way, we'd _love_ your help.  If you're extra good, you'll get commit rights to the core repository (hint: this one) if you want them.

## RefineryCMS-Wiki

A wiki would present better options for contribution to the site. This is a plugin collaboration taking place here: [http://github.com/parndt/refinerycms-wiki](http://github.com/parndt/refinerycms-wiki)

## RefineryCMS-Blog

A blog would also improve how tutorials are categorized and tagged. You can watch and contribute to that process here:
